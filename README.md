## <a name="about"></a> About

An UI Kit library built on top of **[Angular](https://angular.dev/)** and **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, designed to help you deliver accessible, user-experience–focused web applications with speed and consistency.

This library provides:

- A collection of reusable directives to simplify common UI patterns.

- Utility functions to reduce boilerplate and promote clean code.

- Injection tokens for flexible and decoupled configuration.

- Predefined constants and structured data models to support standardized integration.

- Strong accessibility (a11y) support, aligned with WAI-ARIA best practices.

- First-class support for Angular Signals (if targeting Angular 16+).

Fully compatible with modern Angular (v16+), and optimized for scalability, customization, and seamless integration into existing Angular applications.
